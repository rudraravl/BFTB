I'm a student at The University of Texas at Austin, and I'm studying Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Cockrell School of Engineering. I love making things and I'm excited to keep building once I graduate in 2026.

Aside from school, I love cars and photography. Ever since my first Lightning McQueen toy, I've been intersted in all things cars. My preference goes to the JDM subculture, but I would never say no to a Koenigsegg if anyone is offering one. If that's too much, I'm also taking Nissan 300ZX donations. Of course, along with a love of cars comes an F1 obsession. I've currently got my fingers crossed that Danny Ric gets a drive in the new Red Bull this year, I need to see him run one more good race. Photography has also been a longtime passion of mine. I've been snapping pictures since 6th grade and I still try to keep it up as a side business.

I've also been getting into mountain biking, but I have a long way to go there. I love the excitement of rolling up and down hilly trails, but I didn't love the pain of breaking my wrist when I got a bit too confident on a bit too high of a drop.

This blog is a passion project of mine, inspired by the new topics my mom was exposed to after being elected up to a position on our local school board. She told me about the inquiries and complaints she was exposed to as a board member, and asked me to help her learn more about the context of the things she heard. As I explained, I learned new things as well, and I realized that much of what my mom and I discussed could also benefit other people like us. That led to the idea of writing down these questions people had, and trying to explain them in a way that exposes the relevance in our daily lives. This is my place to toss out thoughts, help explain some topics, and share the things I learn. This is my collection of Blogs From the Burbs.
